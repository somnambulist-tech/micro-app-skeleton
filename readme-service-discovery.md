# Service Discovery

When running with [data service](https://github.com/somnambulist-tech/data-service-skeleton) it is
possible to setup service auto-discovery.

[Traefik](https://traefik.io) is being used as a load-balancer and proxy for the main data
service and provided that you follow a few simple steps, any number of micro-services can be
associated with it.

## Automatic Service Discovery

Traefik acts as a proxy and load balancer in a similar way to nginx. It listens on port 80 (or any other)
and provides a gui (usually on 8080, but proxy.example.dev:80 gives access as well). LetsEncrypt can
be setup to provide SSL as well as HTTP auth etc.

To register containers with Traefik (called `proxy` in the data project), you need to label the container
with specific tags. Any web service should be labeled with:

 * traefik.enable: true
 * traefik.http.routers.service.rule: "Host(`service.example.dev`)"
 * traefik.http.routers.service.tls: true
 * traefik.http.services.service.loadbalancer.server.port: 8080

For example: to expose the example Web App and have Traefik route it:

```yaml
services:
  app-web:
    build:
      dockerfile: src/Resources/docker/dev/web/Dockerfile
      context: .
    networks:
      - app_example_network
    labels:
      traefik.enable: true
      traefik.http.routers.app.rule: "Host(`app.example.dev`)"
      traefik.http.routers.app.tls: true
      traefik.http.services.app.loadbalancer.server.port: 8080
```

The `port` is the INTERNAL container port, the frontend rule is how it should be accessed via
Traefik. We could require the previous port by changing the `rule` to: `Host(``app.example.dev:4011``)`

All that is left to do is `dc up -d` and now Traefik will pick up the new container and it will
be available immediately.

If you `dc down` services will automatically be removed.

As the Traefik config is done through labels, they can be added safely to docker-compose files
without interfering with any other configuration. 

__Note:__ you need to ensure that the network is defined as an external type so that your containers
will join the same resources. This network name is defined in the data-service project.

__Note:__ The Traefik options must reference the container name. In the example above the container is
named `app` and the labels reference this as `routers.app.*` and `services.app.*`. If you name your 
container something else e.g.: foobarbaz, then these would be `routers.foobarbaz.` and
`services.foobarbaz.*`.

__Note:__ Traefik can only route CGI / HTTP processes. php-fpm needs to be proxied via a web server
such as nGinx or Apache. When creating your site config ensure that you setup the listener to be
a port other than 80 or 443 as these are already in use by Traefik.
